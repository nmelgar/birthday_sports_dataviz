# Does Your Birthday Make You Better At Sports?

Short intro

## Background

Matthew 25:29 in the bible explains that “whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them” which has lead many researchers to describe how some get more and others get less as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect">Matthew effect</a> in our society. 

One way to evaluate this effect is to look at professional athletes. Malcolm Gladwell studies the birth dates of successful hockey players in a chapter of his 2008 non-fiction book Outliers to provide an example of the Matthew Effect. 

## The Challenge

Hockey’s cutoff date is December 31st, but baseball’s cutoff date has historically been July 31st. Football’s cutoff is July 31st too, but they also have weight categories as well for older ages. Basketball’s Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) cutoff date is August 31st.

Malcolm Gladwell’s chapter on the Matthew Effect is persuasive as a narrative. He even has a couple of tables. After reading his Matthew Effect chapter, your job is to create a few persuasive visualizations about the birthday distributions within each sport. In addition, you will need to compare the sport birthday distributions to the distribution of birthdays in the US population to verify that the two groups are in fact different.  

You can find varied data sources available for use in the sources folder. You will need to use more than one of the data sets provided, but you are not expected to use them all.
