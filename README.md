# Does Your Birthday Make You Better At Sports?

Short intro

## Background

Matthew 25:29 explains that “whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them” which has lead many researchers to describe how some get more and others get less as the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect">Matthew effect</a> in our society. 

One way to evaluate this effect is to look at professional athletes. Malcolm Gladwell studies the birth dates of successful hockey players in a chapter of his 2008 non-fiction book Outliers to provide an example of the Matthew Effect. Please read the Matthew Effect (chapter one) (Links to an external site.) to get more background.
